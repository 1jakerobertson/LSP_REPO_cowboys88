# AI_PROMPTS_A3

## Overview
This document explains the sequence of AI prompts I used while developing and improving my ETL pipeline project. The prompts show how I iteratively solved errors, fixed environment issues, and then refactored the code into a more object-oriented design.

## File Path Errors

- Ran into a couple problems when restructring my files, led to me needing to edit my file paths

Prompt: Shared my full ETLPipeline.java and asked why it couldnâ€™t find products.csv.

AI Guidance: Diagnosed that ../data/products.csv pointed to the wrong location. Suggested two fixes:

Run from src so ../data works.

Or change code to Paths.get("data", "products.csv") so the program runs cleanly from the project root.


## OOP Refractor Request
AI Guidance: Broke the pipeline into multiple classes with single responsibilities:

Product (model class)

ProductReader / CsvProductReader

ProductTransformer

CsvProductWriter

ETLPipeline (orchestrator with main)

This modular design makes the program more reusable, testable, and closer to real-world OOP practices.
